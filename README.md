# Instructions- 

- Use Bloc Pattern Only for all task:
Don't use unnecessary packages. Use only standard packages
- ALL task(directory/files of project) should well structured and easily readable. 
- The naming of files/directory should be simple and to the point 
Also, push your code to Github.

### Task 2:Update the Note App features

1. Use the Same App to work on the second task.
1. In Add Notes Screen there should be an option to add a video link with a checkbox button(i.e edit text should not visible unless the checkbox is clicked ).
Also, this feature is different from the description part.
1. In the Detail note screen, if a note contains a video link, there should be a clickable button to play the video(on the new screen and in the app only).
The video should have the feature of play and pause.

#### Use SQFLITe to store data locally also
(only read operation)(don't use firestone/firebase offline functionality ),
this feature will be only used to show data when there is no internet access.

No need to show a play/pause video screen if there is no internet access.
